CSS transitions were added back in 2013 and they are a powerful way to add motion to your interface. But if you're using transition: all, you're likely hurting performance and introducing bugs. Here's why.

<br />

### What all Actually Does

When you write:

```css
transition: all 0.3s ease;
```

the browser interprets this as: "Animate every property that changes." That includes layout-affecting properties like `width`, `height`, `margin`, and `padding`, as well as paint and composite properties like `color`, `box-shadow`, and `transform`.

This sounds convenient, but it's a bad idea.

1. Unpredictable Behavior
   Using `all` means you‚Äôre not specifying which properties should animate. If a new property gets added later, it might animate unexpectedly. This can lead to visual glitches or broken layouts.

2. Performance Hits
   Not all CSS properties are cheap to animate. Some trigger layout recalculations or repainting, which are expensive operations. For example:

- `width` and `height` can trigger layout
- `color` and `box-shadow` can trigger paint
- `transform` and `opacity` are GPU-accelerated and safe to animate

When you use `all`, the browser has to check every property and decide how to animate it. This adds overhead and can slow down your page, especially on lower-end devices.

3. Harder Debugging
   If something animates and you didn‚Äôt expect it to, tracking down the cause is harder when `all` is used. You lose clarity. Explicit transitions make your code easier to read and maintain.

<br />

### What to Do Instead

Be specific. Only animate properties that are safe and necessary.

```css
transition:
  transform 0.3s ease,
  opacity 0.3s ease;
```

This tells the browser exactly what to animate. It avoids layout thrashing and keeps your UI smooth.

<br />

### Summary

Avoid `transition: all`. It‚Äôs vague, inefficient, and unpredictable. Use specific properties like transform and opacity instead. Your interface will feel faster and your code will be easier to manage.
